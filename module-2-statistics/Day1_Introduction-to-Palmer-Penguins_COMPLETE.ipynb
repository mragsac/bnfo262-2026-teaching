    "## Notebook Information\n",
    "\n",
    "The first version of this lesson was originally written by myself and Clarence Mah when we were teaching assistants for CMM 262 in Winter Quarter 2020 and Winter Quarter 2021. It was then adapted in the R Programming Langugage by Graham McVicker in 2022 when he took over the module until 2025.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since you spent Week 1 learning some Python and UNIX commands, I've re-adapted this lesson in Python instead of R! However, the R code is still available (including the [2025 iteration](https://github.com/biom262/bnfo262-2025/blob/main/module-2-statistics/Day1_1_Statistics_and_Data_Visualization.Rmd)) in case you're interested in comparing the differences between the two languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've also included various HTML blocks! Here's a key of what they each represent:\n",

    "## Dataset Background\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned during the in-class lecture, we will be going through the **Palmer Penguins** dataset in this Jupyter Notebook! The Palmer Penguins dataset is based on data points collected and made available by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://pal.lternet.edu/), a member of the [Long Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/).\n",

    "## Notebook Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we even go into the dataset, we can start off by importing the Python packages (or `dependencies`) that are needed to properly run the code in this notebook. These packages should look familiar (e.g., `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`)\n",
    "\n",
    "The information here is a review from the exercises from last week, but I wanted to include the information here just in case you wanted to re-read things! :-)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `pandas` Package\n",
    "\n",
    "The [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) package is commonly used to interact with table-like data and perform various operations on it. You can think of it like Microsoft Excel, Apple Numbers, Google Sheets, etc. but instead of mostly looking at things visually, you'll be performing calculations and visualizations based on on rows and columns!\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `matplotlib` Package\n",
    "\n",
    "The [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) package allows you to visualize data in Python. While it's pretty barebones, it is **extremely** powerful and allows you to fine-tune plots to your liking!\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `seaborn` Package\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, this is optional, but another commonly used package is [`seaborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/). You can think of `seaborn` as a wrapper for `matplotlib` to make things prettier! However, since it was built with statistical visualizations in mind, it has additional capabilities to make generation of commonly used scientific plots a little easier (i.e., clustering heatmaps with the [`seaborn.clustermap()`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.clustermap.html) method among others).\n",

You should always compute summary statistics, but also **visualize** your data at all stages to see what is going on.\n",
